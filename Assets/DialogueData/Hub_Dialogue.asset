  - 'Riley has woken up in the middle of the night with a weird feeling. Upon noticing
    that some of their favorite toys are gone, they frantically search all throughout
    their bedroom only to find zero traces of them! '
  - "Instead of finding their toys, the child finds portals in the darkest parts
    of their room. Not knowing they were stepping into a nightmare, the child goes
    in, equipped with a ball and flashlight, hoping to gather clues of where their
    toys might be\u2026\r\n"
  - 'The portals are:  underneath their creaky bed, buried deep in their closet,
    and behind the curtain of the window. Complete all three levels to defeat the
    nightmare!'
  - 'Tip: Press P to Pause and revisit the Settings and Guide menus. The Guide menu
    can also be accessed through the blackboard.'
